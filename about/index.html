            <p>
              My name is Chelsea Gieck and I am a Junior at UNC. I am a nontraditional student who is returning after taking some time off. During my time out of school, I worked as a bartender for a large bar and event staffing company. During this time, I taught myself coding languages including HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and jQuery. I also completed certifications through Google. Through learning through online means, I was able to get different freelance web development and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) jobs. I worked primarily with WordPress and Google platforms, like AdWords and Analytics. I was drawn to working as a developer because I was able to work from anywhere in the world. I traveled frequently throughout the United States to staff large events with my bartending job, but I wanted to do something creative that I could do from anywhere, and development was a perfect fit.
            </p>

            <p>
              During my time out of school, I spent a lot of time traveling through Europe and the United States. My favorite city that I have ever visited is Paris, France. Glasgow, Scotland is a close second. I do not believe I would be who I am today without traveling and expanding my worldview. Every time I travel to a new city, or a city that I have been to before, I feel like I learn or see something new. My last long trip abroad was for 45 days, and it was during this time that I decided to stop bartending because I wanted to work full-time as a developer. After making this decision and returning to the United States, I worked a few more events but spent most of my time learning more about development and building things for my portfolio. I completed several online certifications and eventually enrolled in a six-month Full-Stack web development certification at the UNC Friday Center.
            </p>

            <p>
              After completing these certifications and building my portfolio, I was able to get a full-time job as a Web Developer at RTI International. RTI International is a large non-profit research instutite focused on improving the human condition. It is located in Research Triangle Park, NC.
